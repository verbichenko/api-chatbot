API_SCOPE_CATEGORIES = """

In Scope Categories for API Support:

[Technical Troubleshooting & Bug Reports]: This category is for all technical issues and unexpected API behavior. It includes, but is not limited to:
    - API errors and performance issues (e.g., error codes, rate limiting).
    - Webhook malfunctions (e.g., delivery failures, duplicate notifications).
    - Data integrity and discrepancies.
    - Failures in third-party integrations.
    - Any other unexpected or undocumented API behavior.

  [Configuration & Developer Environment]: This category includes all requests related to the setup and maintenance of the developer environment. This covers:
    - Management of developer accounts, sandboxes, and access credentials.
    - Configuration and adjustments of access scopes, rate limits, webhooks, URLs, and email notifications.

  [Integration Lifecycle Management]: This category pertains to all stages of an application's lifecycle, from initial submission to post-launch changes. Key areas are:
    - The process of application submission, approval, validation, and publication.
    - Requests for application removal or changes to marketing materials.
    - General inquiries regarding partnerships and the integration process.

  [How-To on API Usage & Functionality]: This category addresses questions about the practical application and understanding of the API's features. This category is for guidance on:
    - Best practices for integration and application development.
    - Clarification on API capabilities, endpoints, and data formats (request/response).
    - Exploring potential API use cases.

Out of Scope Categories for API Support:

  [Out of Scope / Miscellaneous]: This category is for any incoming request that does not fall into the above categories:
   - Spam and marketing messages.
   - No clear two-party dialogue: The ticket lacks a clear exchange where a Customer asks a question and a Support Agent answers (e.g., messages only from the customer, or only from the agent, ticket consits only of private notes).
   - Requests for non-API related support (e.g., account billing, product usage).
   - Unspecific requests that are too generic or lack sufficient detail to categorize.
   - Other irrelevant communications.
  [Feature Gaps & Enhancement Requests]: This category captures feedback and suggestions for improving the API. This includes:
    - Requests for new API endpoints or attributes.
    - Suggestions for additional API functionality.
    - Business cases that cannot be addressed by the current API.

  [Action Requests]: Requests that require the support team to take a direct action on the customer's behalf. Not for instructions or information on how the customer can perform the action themselves.

  Include (examples):
    - Escalating an issue to Engineering.
    - Activating an account or approving an application.
    - Creating a webhook.
    - Providing a test/sandbox account.
    - Increasing an API rate limit or quota.
    - Changing an app's configuration on the customer's behalf.

  Exclude:
   - How-to guidance, troubleshooting steps, or documentation intended for self-service.

      - Each request must be independent and self-contained.
      - If a request is vague or lacks detail, infer and expand upon it to be as specific as possible based on the ticket's context.
      - Consolidate multiple mentions of the same issue into a single request. Do not create duplicate or overly similar requests.

  5.  Include all relevant context in the extracted request. This includes information that provides context for the customer's problem, such as:
      - Error codes and error messages
      - Descriptions of faulty API behavior
      - Program code examples
